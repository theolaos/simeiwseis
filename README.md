## Suggested file structure.

For your first pull request, create a folder with your name. And inside it add your Obsidian Notes Filestructure.

Example:
```
/simeiwseis
|- /theolaos
|---- Math I
|---- Physics
|- /Nikos
|---- Math I
|---- Κυκλώματα
|...
```

It is assumed that we are at the 1st semester. So please do not create excess unnecessary folder bloat.
